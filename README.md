# Pathways

## Intro
Pathways is a website for a yet-to-be-created educational technology platform that uses machine learning to create learning 'pathways' and aid instructors in building courses.

This project is built with Node.JS, EJS, Express, Sass, Boostrap, and Mongo to simulate an actual website for a pre-seed start up. 

## Pathways features
- Responsive design for ergonomic use on desktop and mobile
- Email collection powered by Mongo/Mongoose
- EJS powered templates designed for extendability and easy site modification
- Modern design powered by custom Sass and Bootstrap 

## Get started

To view the site:
1. Clone the Pathways repo
2. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies
3. Ensure Sass is being compiled via running `--watch scss/styles.scss public/stylesheets/main.scss`
4. Create .env file in the src directory and create and add a variable called `MONGOOSE_URI` containing the app credentials from your own MongoDB cluster. 
5. Run `npm run dev` to view the website
